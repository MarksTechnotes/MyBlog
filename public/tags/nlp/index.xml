      <description>&lt;p&gt;Transformers have become the foundation of modern language models like GPT, PaLM, and LLaMA. But their internal workings — attention heads, Q/K/V projections, sinusoidal positional encodings, feed-forward networks — can feel overwhelming. Ironically or probably aptly, I used ChatGPT which is based on the Transformers architecture to help explain to me the concepts and it did a great job.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This post which is a summary of the sessions I had with ChatGPT explains these concepts clearly and intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
